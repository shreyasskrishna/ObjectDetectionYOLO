# 🚀 Object Detection Using YOLOv4 and Webcam  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project implements real-time object detection using **YOLOv4** and **OpenCV**. It captures webcam images, processes them through a YOLOv4-based deep learning model, and identifies objects in real time. The system is designed for applications such as **traffic control, crime detection, and rare species monitoring**.  

## 🛠️ Features  
- ✅ **Real-Time Detection** – Uses YOLOv4 for fast and accurate object recognition.  
- ✅ **Webcam Integration** – Captures and processes frames directly from a webcam.  
- ✅ **Multiple Applications** – Enhances traffic management, assists in crime prevention, and improves wildlife monitoring.  
- ✅ **Google Colab Support** – Runs seamlessly on Colab with GPU acceleration.  

## 🔧 Technologies Used  
- 🖥️ **YOLOv4** – State-of-the-art object detection model.  
- 📷 **OpenCV** – Image processing and webcam integration.  
- 🐍 **Python & NumPy** – Data handling and processing.  
- ☁️ **Google Colab** – Cloud-based execution with GPU support.  

## 📸 How It Works  
1. **Loads YOLOv4 Model** – Initializes the network with pre-trained weights.  
2. **Captures Webcam Images** – Uses JavaScript and OpenCV to retrieve real-time frames.  
3. **Processes Image for Detection** – Converts frames to a suitable format for YOLOv4.  
4. **Detects and Classifies Objects** – Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects.  
5. **Displays Results** – Outputs the detected objects along with confidence scores.  

## 🎯 Applications  
- 🚦 **Traffic Management** – Detects vehicles and pedestrians for better road monitoring.  
- 🏢 **Crime Detection** – Identifies suspicious activities in surveillance footage.  
- 🌍 **Wildlife Monitoring** – Tracks endangered species for conservation efforts.
